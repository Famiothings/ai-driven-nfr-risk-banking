All detailed steps for preprocessing, EDA, visual representations, model creation and training are documented with reproducible code and can be found in 'AI_Driven_NFR_Prediction_for_Banking.ipynb'. The whole notebook is designed and coded to be fully executable in Google Colab.
There is no separate script folder.
